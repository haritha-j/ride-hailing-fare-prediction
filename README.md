# Ride Fare Classification Project

the notebook is split into three sections.

## Visualization and feature engineering

In this section the data is explored and visaulized to understand the nature of data.
Next a number of feature engineering methods are used to idenitfy the most ideal features required for the task. 
*unused feature engineering methods are commented out

## SKLEARN models

First a few pre-processing steps are also applied to ensure that the data is ready for training a classifier.

Next a number of classification methods are used in experiments to determine the ideal classification technique. After determining the best model using evaluation metrics, predictions are calculated for the test data.

## KERAS models

*This section is not used for the final submission, due to lower accuracy. 

In this section neural network based approaches are explored. After plotting the training and test performance of these approaches, predictions are calculated for the test data.
